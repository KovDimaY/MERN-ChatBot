  `I am a very passionate software developer with a mathematical

  `I am a very methodological and disciplined person,
  I like when things are done in time and with the best
  possible quality. I love test coverage, CI and strict
  ESLint rules but also I like to experiment and to try
  new approaches when I see that something could be improved.
  I am very hardworking and a bit crazy about learning - I
  cannot imagine my life without Coursera, Udemy and GitHub.`,

  player who can have fun and support others but also to be strict and
  demanding when needed. I am always trying to find something positive
  to keep an optimistic attitude and to be happy. I use sport and photography
  when I need to distract and relax.`,

      free time doing some programming or learning about it. My passion
      started in the university, where I learned creating different games
      in C++, C# and Python. Now I enjoy a lot creating different web
      applications, especially if they can be helpful or interesting
      for other people. For the moment, the most pleasure I have working
      with Javascript, more precisely with Node and React.`,

      football, volleyball or basketball. While studying, I was playing
      quite seriously - I was even a captain of the faculty team in the
      university. Also I was very dedicated for several years to
      bodybuilding and powerlifting and I reached significant results,
      gaining more than 30 kg of body mass and good strength metrics.
      Also I enjoy playing table tennis, chess, billiard, running, cycling,
      swimming and other activities. Sport helps to keep fit my body and mind

      interest for Rubik’s cubes. I have a collection of different sizes
      from 2x2 to 10x10 and my dream is to get a cube of 17x17. I do not
      really like speed cubing, I prefer solving them slowly and without
      pressure, normally it helps me to relax and to distract my brain from
      possible stresses. For example, to solve the cube of size 10x10 I normally
      spend 3-4 hours.`,

      I have around 2000 different coins from different countries and this number
      is growing every year. Most of them I got while traveling or from my friends.
      I do not have some super special coins, my idea is just to collect as many
      different coins and I can.`,

      shot, including editing and retouching. My favourite kind of photography
      is portrait. Making pictures of people is the most enjoyable for me but,
      also, I like to make pictures of animals and nature. I love when the picture
      is full of bright colours especially green, blue, yellow and red. I have a dream
      to make a photo exhibition and to make a short movie some day.`,
