      started in the university, where I learned creating different games
      in C++, C# and Python. Now I enjoy a lot creating different web
      applications, especially if they can be helpful or interesting

      quite seriously - I was even a captain of the faculty team in the
      university. Also I was very dedicated for several years to
      bodybuilding and powerlifting and I reached significant results,
      gaining more than 30 kg of body mass and good strength metrics.

      really like speed cubing, I prefer solving them slowly and without
      pressure, normally it helps me to relax and to distract my brain from
      possible stresses. For example, to solve the cube of size 10x10 I normally
      spend 3-4 hours."

      Welcome to my new personal project!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask questions as you are speaking to me and try to populate the website with the info my bot will provide. Every page will have a progress bar which indicates how much info you have already recovered - so you will know where to stop asking about some particular topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
       
      <b>
        "
        What is your name?
        "
      </b>
       
      sounds like a good question to start, but it can be something else too, just use your imagination ;)
