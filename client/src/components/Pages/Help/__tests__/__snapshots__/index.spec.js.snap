    As this is a learning project, I want you to access easily to all the hidden places of the project, even if normally users should not access them. In my case, they are: 404 page and documentations in Sorybook and Styleguidist. This is something internal but maybe someone of you will want to check these pages too, so here you have the links:

    className="shortcut-links-wrapper"

    <li>
      <a
        className="waves-effect waves-light btn-large light-blue lighten-1"
        href="/docs/storybook"
      >
        <i
          className="material-icons left"
        >
          book
        </i>
        Storybook
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a
        className="waves-effect waves-light btn-large purple lighten-1"
        href="/docs/styleguide"
      >
        <i
          className="material-icons left"
        >
          widgets
        </i>
        Styleguidist
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link
        className="waves-effect waves-light btn-large teal lighten-1"
        to="/not-found"
      >
        <i
          className="material-icons left"
        >
          location_off
        </i>
        404 page
      </Link>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p
    className="text"

    Also, if you are completely stuck and you have no idea what question to ask in order to open some data you want to get - here you can see the list of examples for all the questions that you need to open 100% of the information on all the pages. As you can see, it is pretty straightforward and simple to open all the data and you do not need to ask a lot.

    Notice, that these questions are only examples and you do not have to ask exactly the same questions. My bot should understand many different ways of asking about these topics. So you are welcome try different variations to see how flexible it is. And if you are lazy and you do not want to play with the bot - here you can find a link to my
