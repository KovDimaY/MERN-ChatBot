 * Also it has a hover effect and when is clicked - redirects to the
 * official website with the original version of the certificate.
 * If is not discovered, the images is changed by the image of question marks
 * and the title also is hidden from the user. Also, when is not discovered,
 * the link is changed by the usual div so it does not redirect anywhere.
