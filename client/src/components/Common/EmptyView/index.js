        For the moment you have not discovered anything regarding this topic. To
        get some info - ask the bot right question. When the bot gives you some
        related answer - the information will appear on this page. You will have
        a progress bar that will help you to understand how much info you have
        opened already.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,{' '}
        <b>
          {'"'}
          {suggestion}
          {'"'}
        </b>{' '}
        sounds like a great question to start, but it can be something else too,
        just use your imagination ;)
